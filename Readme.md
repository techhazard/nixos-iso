# NixOS with ZFS on LUKS


### This repository is no longer maintained, but feel free to fork and improve
This was made before native encryption in ZFS existed (pre OpenZFS 2.0), and last updated in August of 2017.
Feel free to fork and improve :)



After some effort (and asking for help on the nix-dev mailing list) I 
installed ZFS on an encrypted partition. The relevant configuration is
below.

- [Installing](#installing)
  - [Use keyfile](#use-keyfile)
  - [Configure passphrase](#configure-passphrase)
  - [Configure without passphrase](#configure-without-passphrase)
- [Misc commands](#misc-commands) 
- [To Do](#to-do)
- [Resources I used](#resources-i-used)
- [Installing with old script](#installing-with-old-script)

## Installing
*I do not have a custom iso yet, so you'll need two USBs. One for the NixOS iso, and one for these files. You'll have to mount the second stick manually.*

1. Boot into the nixos environment and find the uuid or id of the disk you want to install to. Do not use `/dev/sda` but `/dev/disk/by-...`, use `lsblk` and `blkid`.
2. export it to the environment as `rootdisk`:
```sh
# whole disk please, no partition
export rootdisk="/dev/disk/by-id/ata-Some-Storage-Device"
```
3. [use keyfile](#use-keyfile) and/or [configure passphrase](#configure-passphrase) usage (see sections below)
4. run it:
```sh
bash /path/to/automated_install.sh
```
### Use keyfile
It is possible to use a keyfile (e.g. on a usb stick). If you want a keyfile and not have a passphrase for backup, see [Configure without passphrase](#configure-without-passphrase) below.
```sh
# part of step 3
export keyfile="/dev/disk/by-id/usb-Some-Usb-Stick"
# optional, default is 4096
export keysize="8192"
```
### Configure passphrase
It is possible to pass the passphrase in an environment variable to make the install fully automated. This is generally unwise, but since we are in a temporary live enviorment I consider it safe enough. You can also put it as `passphrase="your passphrase here"` in `automated_install.sh` on line `16` instead.
If you add a keyfile as well, both are added.
```sh
# part of step 3
export passphrase="your passphrase here"
```
### Configure without passphrase
If you only want to add a keyfile and not set a passphrase, set `use_passphrase` to `no`. This is not recommended.
```sh
# part of step 3
export use_passphrase="no"
# see Use keyfile above
export keyfile="/path/to/keyfile"
```

## Misc commands
I always run these command right after booting the install usb.
```sh
# I use programmer dvorak instead of qwerty
loadkeys dvorak-programmer
```

## To Do 
- [x] use nixos-rebuild to make an iso containing the files
- [x] customise the iso with ZFS support and these files
- [x] find the location of `automated_install.sh` in the built iso.
- [ ] update Readme :-P

## Resources I used
I used the following resources:  
- https://nixos.org/wiki/ZFS_on_NixOS#How_to_install_NixOS_on_a_ZFS_root_filesystem
- https://nixos.org/wiki/Encrypted_Root_on_NixOS
- http://www.pavelkogan.com/2014/05/23/luks-full-disk-encryption/
- https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF

## Installing with old script
use this version of the files: [old version](https://gist.github.com/awesomefireduck/c763e168a62a0ef559a1fb9473261459/a92e653ae949972d12738a1f7e042eceb832dadf). All text below is about those versions, not the ones you see here.

The commands in `init.sh` I run manually, (so no sed :-P)

The `zfscreate.sh` is used to set up a single-disk ZFS root filesystem inside of an encrypted LUKS container.

The two `*.nix` files have the minimum config needed for this (compare them with the generated ones in `/mnt/etc/nixos/`); The UUIDs should be filled-in by `nixos-generate-config`; 
the `"usb_storage"` addition is not needed for everyone, just like the `keyfile` options; the other important changes
are the `hostId`, which is required by ZFS; and the `boot.supportedFilesystems` which I'm not even sure of if that's necessary
